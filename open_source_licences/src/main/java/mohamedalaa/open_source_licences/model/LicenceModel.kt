/**
 * - **ONLY** [preLicenseContentSpecificToOpenSource] && [listOfAuthorsNames] can be empty which then
 * for 2nd one will be replaced with "Unknown" isa.
 * - **VIP NOTE** DO NOT add Apache 2.0 license sine it's already added isa.
 *
 * @param listOfAuthorsNames if more than 1 then all names will be added separated by comma and space
 * like this ", " without the quotes isa.
 *
 * @param preLicenseContentSpecificToOpenSource
 * - used in case the [openSourceName] has specific
 * line(s) needed to be added before the licence content in the licence detail activity isa.
 * - Ex. we have 7 diff [openSourceName] with same licence so we have in assets only 1 licence
 * but each [openSourceName] have let's say 1 line needed to be distinguish pre license content
 * like Copyright (c) 2019 Mohamed Alaa for 1st one, and Copyright Â© [year] [name] for 2nd and so on
 * so we still will add 1 .txt and use this field for these variations to make most possible
 * low size for .txt files isa.
 * - Also note each item in the list represents a line so you can add empty item to be an empty line
 * and after every thing is added an empty line will be added before content in .txt file isa.
